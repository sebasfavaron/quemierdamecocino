Inspired by [What The Fuck Should I Make For Dinner?](https://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/index.php), with a more Argentinian twist

Using (for now) scraped links from [PaulinaCocina](https://www.paulinacocina.net)

## Roadmap

- Add more Argentinian recipes
- Exclude recipes that are not full meals (like coffee, bread, sauces, etc)
